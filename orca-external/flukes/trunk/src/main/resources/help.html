<h2>FLUKES Help</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>FLUKES allows you to graphically create the topology of your ORCA request, assign IP addresses, VM images to nodes and edit global reservation details. There are several tabs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request pane - for creating the request graph</li>
<li>Resources pane - for inspecting available resources</li>
</ul>

<h3>User interface - Request pane</h3>

<p>The Request is created using the Request pane and can be saved/loaded into a NDL-OWL formatted file that can be submitted to ORCA for provisioning (note that ORCA accepts only RDF-XML).</p>

<p>There are 3 mouse modes accessible from the right-click menu anywhere:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit - for creating nodes and edges</li>
<li>Pick - for picking one or more nodes (holding the left mouse button while dragging selects multiple nodes)</li>
<li>Pan - panning the graph image within the pane</li>
</ul> 

<p>Right-clicking on node or edge shows a context menu that allows you to view and edit node and edge properties.</p>

<p>In pick mode you can select multiple nodes (by clicking on a node or clicking and dragging to create a select area) and edit their common properties (e.g. image, domain binding etc) by right clicking 
anywhere except node or edge and selecting 'Edit Selected Nodes'.</p>

<h3>Node Types and IP address assignment</h3>
 
 <p>Two node types are possible - plain node (a VM with either a default image or an image specified by the user) or a cluster. A cluster is a set of 
 nodes in a bus configuration usually allocated from one site possibly connected to other clusters or nodes over a Layer 2 connection (e.g. a VLAN). Similar parameters
 can be specified for nodes and clusters. For clusters, a number of nodes should be specified, also the 
 IP address specified is the address to be assigned to the <it>first node</it>, with other addresses sequentially selected from the same address set 
 limited by the netmask. E.g. if there are 3 nodes in a cluster and a user specifies 172.16.1.10/16 then the first node will 
 have 172.16.1.10/16, second 172.16.1.11/16 etc.</p>
  
<h3>Images</h3>
<p>VM Images are defined using the 'Images' button. You can add new images or edit the properties of existing images. Each image must have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A unique short name</li>
<li>A URL of the ImageProxy metafile from which it can be downloaded</li>
<li>A SHA-1 hash of the metafile</li>
</ul>

<p>Images can be specified per reservation (as part of reservation properties) or per node. 
Images must first be defined using the 'Images|New' dialog and then can be used from pull down menus
in reservation and node properties.</p>

<p>If an image is selected for a reservation it takes on global significance and any images specified for nodes are ignored. 
If no image is specified in the reservation you can specify different images for individual nodes. Nodes for which an image is not specified
will use the default image for the site at which the node is allocated.</p>

<h3>User interface - Resources pane</h3>
 
Allows to view available ORCA resources. To be implemented ...

<h3>Graph Layouts</h3>

There are several graph layouts available from a pull-down menu. When a graph is saved in NDL-OWL, its layout is not preserved, so this feature is provided as a convenience. After loading a graph a user can experiment with different layouts to find the most convenient one.
